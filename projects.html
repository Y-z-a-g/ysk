            <h1>This Website</h1>
            <p>I wanted to showcase my HTML and CSS knowledge for anyone to view. What started out learning how to add a gtag to a website, turned into a fun project.</p>
            <h1>UncopyrightedGenres</h1>
            <p>Back on March 3, 2012 I started UncopyrightedGenres. The main goal was to share non-copyright music, offering a collection that could be freely used for various projects. In the early stages, the channel had a different focus and the content from those days was eventually made unlisted, marking a shift in the project's direction. The evolution from there has been a journey of discovering and sharing music in a way that respects artists' rights while providing value to the audience. The channel is now known as Leafy Radio and currently sits at over 350K subscribers and 124M video views!</p>
